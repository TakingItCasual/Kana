# Kana
Japanese kana learning app for Android

My first Android application (and also my first time programming in java, and my first time properly using git). End goal is an app where hiragana and katakana can be studied via romaji with flashcards, multiple choice, and typing tests. Another goal is to allow testing in both directions (kana to romaji and romaji to kana). A hopeful would have to do with draw testing (I have no idea where to even begin with that one though, hence the "hopeful").
